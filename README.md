# AngularDemo
A demo of using Angular to simplify SPA architecture for a RESTful service taken from a course I did.
SPA is significantly simplified using Angular Templates and ui.router. A RESTful service is set up using json-server.
ngResource is used to mediate between the Factories/Services and Controllers.
If you have node installed, you don't need to build this project - the public folder in the json-server folder is pre-populated,
so just just double click the serve.bat file goto http://localhost:3000/index in your browser.
